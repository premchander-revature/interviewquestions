50. What will be the output of the following by using  Inner JOINS?
Table 1:
CREATE TABLE dbo.envelope(id int, user_id int);

INSERT INTO dbo.envelope VALUES(1,1);
INSERT INTO dbo.envelope VALUES(2,2);
INSERT INTO dbo.envelope VALUES(3,3);

Table 2:

CREATE TABLE dbo.docs(idnum int, pageseq int, doctext varchar(100));

INSERT INTO dbo.docs(idnum,pageseq) VALUES(1,5);
INSERT INTO dbo.docs(idnum,pageseq) VALUES(2,6);
INSERT INTO dbo.docs(idnum,pageseq) VALUES(null,0);

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>


Syntax:

UPDATE docs SET doctext=pageseq FROM docs INNER JOIN envelope ON envelope.id=docs.idnum
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM dbo.docs
  WHERE id=envelope.id);

Output:
                   |  idnum  |  pageseq  |  doctext  |
                   |---------|-----------|-----------|
                   |   1     |    5      |    5      |
                   |   2     |    6      |    6      |
                   |  NULL   |    0      |   NULL    |
Explanation: 
* The above query's EXISTS clause is a red herring. Given that ID is not a member of dbo.docs, it will always be true. As a result, it will mention the comparison between the envelope table and itself!

* Since the join of NULL will not produce a result when trying to match with any value of envelope, the idnum value of NULL will not be set.
