- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
- Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), etc.,

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

- **Pay as you go** - Pay only when you use computing resources, and only for how much you use.
- **Stop guessing capacity** - When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, you can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes notice.
- **Increase speed and agility** - IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make resources available to your developers from weeks to minutes. This dramatically increases agility for the organization, because the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
- **Realize cost savings** - Companies can focus on projects that differentiate their business instead of maintaining data centers. With cloud computing, you can focus on your customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering physical infrastructure.
- **Go global in minutes** - Applications can be deployed in multiple Regions around the world with a few clicks. This means that you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at a minimal cost.

When transporting data in a cloud computing environment, keep two things in mind: Make sure that no one can intercept your data as it moves from point A to point B in the cloud, and make sure that no data leaks (malicious or otherwise) from any storage in the cloud.

A virtual private network (VPN) is one way to secure data while transported in a cloud. A VPN converts the public network to a private network instead. A well-designed VPN will incorporate two things:

- A firewall will be a barrier between the public and any private network.
- Encryption protects your sensitive data from hackers; only the computer you send it to should have the key to decode the data.
- Check that there is no data leak with the encryption key implemented with the data you send while moving from point A to point B in a cloud.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

**Elasticity** is a system’s ability to increase (or decrease) its varying capacity-related needs such as storage, networking, and computing based on specific criteria.

**Scalability** only adapts to the workload increase through the incremental provision of resources without impacting the system’s overall performance.

An example being, you have a web app that needs to support 1,000 active users for one day, so you meet that demand by provisioning 10 servers in total - but after that one day, you only ever have 10 active users, thus you only need 1 server. In this case, a scalable system would be able to scale to meet the 1,000 active users with the additional 9 servers - so that's cool, our system scaled! But now we're left with an abundance of over-provisioned capacity and we have to deal with that.

If our system was elastic for the above example, the process would have been automatic - our environment would have recognized the increasing workload, so it would have provisioned the necessary resources. Then when that day was over and the workload decreased significantly, our systems would have de-provisioned the servers as we didn't need them anymore.

Cloud providers take cloud security very seriously. Vendors have developed complex security protocols based on encryption and authentication, and take steps to ensure tenants can’t access their neighbor's data.

In general, servers are regulated by the laws of the country they reside in. That means data stored on a European server will be regulated differently than a server in the U.S. Organizations that handle private user data need to be aware of all regulations that may apply to their cloud solutions.

<blockquote>

- In multicloud deployment, we are using several different vendors, each with different processes and technology. So, it becomes complex to manage.
- If services in multiple clouds need to talk to one another in order to fulfill user requests, that can introduce latency, depending on how tightly the clouds are integrated, how far apart the data centers are geographically, and how often multiple clouds need to interact.
- The more pieces of software and hardware that are integrated, the more vulnerabilities there likely are.
- It can be difficult to balance loads across different clouds, especially if the data centers are very far apart geographically.

<blockquote>

 A tenant is a customer who purchases cloud computing resources. This could be an individual user, a group of users, or an entire department or company.
