![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Some reasons:

- Since it discovers defects/bugs before the delivery to the client, which guarantees the high quality of the software.
- It makes the software more reliable and easy to use.
- Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software operation.

3. What is manual software testing, and how does it differ from automated software testing?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Manual software testing is a process where human testers manually run test cases, then generate the resulting test reports. With automation software testing, these functions are executed by automation tools such as test scripts and code. The tester takes the end user’s role to determine how well the app works.

What is the difference between SDLC and STLC?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote> 
  
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process of software development, presented as a set of sequential phases such as:

Planning
Analysis and Design
Implementation (Coding)
Testing
Deployment and Maintenance (in some sources called ‘Evolution,’ to emphasize the importance of Retrospective analysis and Lessons Learned practices which become a background for another software development cycle)
So it can be said that the Software Testing Life Cycle is a part of the Software Development Life Cycle, and represents testing activities held within it. A rule of thumb is to have a testing activity for every development activity, and to start it as early as possible. For instance, test design for each test level should start in parallel with the corresponding development activity.

Which is “better” – white or black box testing?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>
Neither – they are both necessary and complementary. Early white box testing assures code functionality and makes later, higher level testing less time intensive. Thorough black box testing enhances end user experience. Systematic testing procedures, incorporating a variety of strategies and perspectives, result in a solid final product and a successful release.

</blockquote>
</details>
  
---

What are the differences between white box and black box testing?
White box testing usually begins early in the development cycle. It is conducted at lower levels, and includes unit and integration testing. Black box testing is mainly higher level, as in system and acceptance testing, so implementation comes later in the development cycle.

 How can you use the test pyramid model to reduce the number of bugs that make their way into production?
The test pyramid model is a way of thinking about the different types of tests that should be used when developing software. The idea is that there should be more low-level unit tests than higher-level integration tests. This is because unit tests can be run more quickly and cheaply, and they can be used to target specific parts of the code. By having more unit tests, you can find and fix bugs before they make their way into the integration tests and eventually into production.

Explain the states of Bug Lifecycle.


![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

New: When the defect or bug is logged for the first time it is said as New.
Assigned: After the tester has logged a bug, his bug is being reviewed by the tester lead and then it is assigned to the corresponding developer team.
Open: Tester logs a bug in the Open state and it remains in the open state until the developer has performed some task on that bug.
Resolved/Fixed: When a developer has resolved the bug, i.e. now the application is producing the desired output for a particular issue, then the developer changes its status to Resolved/Fixed.
Verified/Closed: When a developer has changed the status to resolved/fixed then the tester now tests the issue at its end and if it’s fixed then he changes the status of the bug to ‘Verified/Close’.
Reopen: If a tester is able to reproduce the bug again i.e. the bug still exists even after fixing by the developer, it’s status is marked as Reopen.
Not a bug/Invalid: A bug can be marked as invalid or not a bug by the developer when the reported issue is as per the functionality but is logged due to misinterpretation.
Deferred: Usually when the bug is of minimal priority for the release and if there is lack of time, in that case, those minimal priority bugs are deferred to the next release.
Cannot Reproduce: If the developer is unable to reproduce the bug at its end by following the steps as mentioned in the issue.


 What is Automation testing?


![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>
Answer: Automation testing is a testing methodology where an automation tool is used to execute the test cases suite in order to increase test coverage as well as speed to test execution. Automation testing does not require any human intervention as it executes pre-scripted tests and is capable of reporting and comparing outcomes with previous test runs.

Repeatability, ease of use, accuracy, and greater consistency are some of the advantages of Automation testing.

Some automation testing tools are listed below:

Selenium
Tellurium
