2. Why do we need to do testing?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Some reasons:

- Since it discovers defects/bugs before the delivery to the client, which guarantees the high quality of the software.
- It makes the software more reliable and easy to use.
- Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software operation.

3. What is manual software testing, and how does it differ from automated software testing?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Manual software testing is a process where human testers manually run test cases, then generate the resulting test reports. With automation software testing, these functions are executed by automation tools such as test scripts and code. The tester takes the end user’s role to determine how well the app works.

**6 Phases:**
  
1. **Requirement Analysis** - Collecting the feature requirements and  identifying testable aspects
2. **Test Planning** - Defining a test strategy and estimating the efforts and costs of the testing team. 
3. **Test Case Development** - Creating test cases. 
4. **Test Environment Setup** - Deciding the test environment conditions on which software is tested.
5. **Test Execution** -  Start executing test cases
6. **Test Closure** - Preparing the test report document

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

The entry and exit criteria for the test are closely related to the purpose and expected results for the test. Each phases in the STLC have entry and exit criteria.
  
- Entry Criteria: Entry Criteria are a set of conditions that need to be satisfied in order to begin the test.
- Exit Criteria: Exit Criteria are a set of conditions that need to be satisfied in order to end the test.

<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Test Closure is a document that gives a summary of all the tests conducted and detailed analysis of the bugs and errors found/fixed/removed.

Its required because it provides below functionalities
- Formally Annouce Closure
- Collate All Results
- Provide Detail Analysis
- Present Test Metrics to the client
- Adjudge Risk

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Black Box Testing is an approach that allows testers to check the functionality of software without looking into its internal structure or coding. 

For example, checking that it is possible to log in using correct user credentials, and not possible to log in using wrong credentials.

11. Which is “better” – white or black box testing?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Neither – they are both necessary and complementary. 

White box testing assures code functionality and makes later, higher level testing less time intensive. 

Thorough black box testing enhances end user experience.

12. What are the differences between white box and black box testing?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

White box testing usually begins early in the development cycle. It is conducted at lower levels, and includes unit and integration testing.

Black box testing is mainly higher level, as in system and acceptance testing, so implementation comes later in the development cycle.

16. What is error, defect, bug and failure?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

A mistake made by a programmer during coding is called an error, an error found during the unit testing in the development phase is called a defect, an error found during the testing phase is called a bug and when an error is found at an end user’s end is called as the failure.
