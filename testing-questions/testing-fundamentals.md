2. **Test Planning** - Defining a test strategy and estimating the efforts and costs of the testing team. 
3. **Test Case Development** - Creating test cases. 
4. **Test Environment Setup** - Deciding the test environment conditions on which software is tested.
5. **Test Execution** -  Start executing test cases
6. **Test Closure** - Preparing the test report document
