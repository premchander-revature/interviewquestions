<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Some reasons:

- Since it discovers defects/bugs before the delivery to the client, which guarantees the high quality of the software.
- It makes the software more reliable and easy to use.
- Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software operation.

3. What is manual software testing, and how does it differ from automated software testing?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Manual software testing is a process where human testers manually run test cases, then generate the resulting test reports. With automation software testing, these functions are executed by automation tools such as test scripts and code. The tester takes the end user’s role to determine how well the app works.

2. **Test Planning** - Defining a test strategy and estimating the efforts and costs of the testing team. 
3. **Test Case Development** - Creating test cases. 
4. **Test Environment Setup** - Deciding the test environment conditions on which software is tested.
5. **Test Execution** -  Start executing test cases
6. **Test Closure** - Preparing the test report document

The entry and exit criteria for the test are closely related to the purpose and expected results for the test. Each phases in the STLC have entry and exit criteria.
  
- Entry Criteria: Entry Criteria are a set of conditions that need to be satisfied in order to begin the test.
- Exit Criteria: Exit Criteria are a set of conditions that need to be satisfied in order to end the test.

Test Closure is a document that gives a summary of all the tests conducted and detailed analysis of the bugs and errors found/fixed/removed.

Its required because it provides below functionalities
- Formally Annouce Closure
- Collate All Results
- Provide Detail Analysis
- Present Test Metrics to the client
- Adjudge Risk

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

Neither – they are both necessary and complementary. 

White box testing assures code functionality and makes later, higher level testing less time intensive. 

Thorough black box testing enhances end user experience.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

White box testing usually begins early in the development cycle. It is conducted at lower levels, and includes unit and integration testing.

Black box testing is mainly higher level, as in system and acceptance testing, so implementation comes later in the development cycle.

18. How can you use the test pyramid model to reduce the number of bugs that make their way into production?
 
![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

The test pyramid model is a way of thinking about the different types of tests that should be used when developing software. 

The idea is that there should be more low-level unit tests than higher-level integration tests. 

This is because unit tests can be run more quickly and cheaply, and they can be used to target specific parts of the code.

By having more unit tests, you can find and fix bugs before they make their way into the integration tests and eventually into production.

20. Explain the states of Bug Lifecycle.


![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

- **New:** When the defect or bug is logged for the first time 
- **Assigned:** Reviewing bug and assigning to the corresponding developer
- **Open:** Tester logs a bug in the open state and it remains in the open state until the developer has performed some task on that bug.
- **Resolved/Fixed**: When a developer has resolved the bug
- **Verified/Closed:** When a developer has changed the status to resolved/fixed then the tester now tests the issue at its end and if it’s fixed then he changes the status of the bug to ‘Verified/Close’.

- **Reopen:** If a tester is able to reproduce the bug again i.e. the bug still exists even after fixing by the developer, it’s status is marked as Reopen.
- **Not a bug/Invalid:** A bug can be marked as invalid or not a bug by the developer when the reported issue is as per the functionality but is logged due to misinterpretation.
- **Deferred:** Usually when the bug is of minimal priority for the release and if there is lack of time, in that case, those minimal priority bugs are deferred to the next release.
- **Cannot Reproduce: **If the developer is unable to reproduce the bug at its end by following the steps as mentioned in the issue.
