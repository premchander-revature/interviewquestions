<blockquote>

Manual software testing is a process where human testers manually run test cases, then generate the resulting test reports. With automation software testing, these functions are executed by automation tools such as test scripts and code. The tester takes the end user’s role to determine how well the app works.

**6 Phases:**
  
1. **Requirement Analysis** - During this phase, feature requirements collected in the SDLC process are evaluated to identify testable aspects. If necessary, testing teams may need to consult with stakeholders to clarify requirements. These requirements can either be functional or non-functional, defining what a feature can do or it’s characteristics respectively.
2. **Test Planning** - This phase includes implementing and defining a test strategy in the testing plan and estimating the efforts and costs of the testing team. 
3. **Test Case Development** - During this phase, testers create test cases. Each test case defines test inputs for data, procedures, execution conditions, and anticipated results.
4. **Environment Setup** - 
5. **Test Execution** - 
6. **Test Closure** -
