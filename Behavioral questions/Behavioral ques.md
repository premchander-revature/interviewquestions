<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample Answer 1: I want to be a software developer because designing computer programs lets me use my creative and problem-solving skills. Software development wasn't my initial career path, but I'm glad I discovered it. In college, I originally studied communications. After obtaining my bachelor's degree in communications, I accepted a job as an editor at a publishing firm. I was responsible for correcting grammatical and stylistic mistakes in clients' work. While I was good at my job and worked hard, the position didn't excite me, so I searched for something more fulfilling. I learned more about the subject via online resources and began to teach myself basic concepts. Eventually, I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science. I enjoyed the challenges that my education presented, and I'm very excited to work as a professional software developer and use the versatile skills that this career demands.

Sample answer 2: I am a Mathematics student. In my eyes, Mathematics is the tool used by the nature to communicate with humans. Similarly, programming is the tool used by humans to communicate with computers. It feels like a great achievement when you finally get the code right after weeks of debugging. Seriously, those who have never done programming will never know the feeling. It feels like a savior when you figure out and implement the edge cases beforehand. In short, programming is challenging, gives me thrills, gives a workout to my brain. That’s why I’m passionate about programming.

6.Have you had any challenges with doing group work such as communication?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample Answer: 
Lack of clarity.
Trust issues.
Personality conflicts.
Withholding information.
Lack of communication
Reduced engagement.
Excessive staff numbers.
Interior competition.
Sample scenario: When I was working with a team of 10 people on a project of content creation, everyone had multiple opinions about executing the task. At times, it led to personal conflicts as well. We, as a team, decided to talk about this and come up with a common strategy that everyone supports and we were successful in accomplishing that. Initially, we had struggles to come up with a common solution due to communication barriers but we figured out ways to resolve and the task is successfully executed.

7.You are on a client project when someone client-facing approached you about a bug and is holding you responsible for the bug that you did not know existed. After some investigation, you find out that your most recent 
build did not cause the bug. How would you handle or approach this situation?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
If you are an ethical and empathetic person you own up to this and let the chips fall where they may. You need to ensure that when you notify your client of the fault, you also inform them of how this mistake occurred and how it will never occur again with documented changes in processes and tests to catch any similar issue in the future. Even though the broken code is from someone else and you are not at fault, do not come up with reasons defending your part. Instead, try to take the responsibility and come up with solutions to resolve this problem. That way, you portray yourself as a good and responsible team player.

9.What are your strengths and weaknesses?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample Answer: To state my strength and weakness can be a little confusing because both two concepts are the same for me. My quality of being self-motivated. I can work hard and consistently to achieve a goal if that helps me in growing and learn. I can motivate myself to do a task even when there are multiple obstacles, and I can complete it. However, my weakness is being over-self-motivated cause in that process I lose myself and get too goal-oriented it is a team task then my self-goals become a burden for them and as a result, I come across clashes and group breakdowns. I have been working on this for the last few months where I set a limit for myself and for the team and try not to affect my goals and objectives becomes the pressure for others.

(For the most part, strengths should include your soft skills. This question is mostly asked to check a candidate’s behavioral skills, your technical skills are tested in your technical interview. No, mentioning your weakness will not affect your performance negatively. However, saying that you have no weaknesses will make you sound arrogant.)

14.Tell me about a time when you had a person that was hampering your progress as a team for a project

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>

Sample Answer:  "I participated in a fellowship program over the summer as a part of my studies. Through the program, I was able to conduct a research project of my own using university resources, like the library's special collections archive, to support my work. I worked alongside three other fellows who were taking part in the program and conducting their own projects. We collaborated while forming our research questions, and one of my coworkers was particularly negative about my approach to my project. I wanted to understand her concerns, so I asked her about them in one of our collaborative meetings.
Unfortunately, she avoided my question. Afterward, I spoke with my research mentor and asked for her guidance. My mentor advised me to speak with my coworker privately, so I invited her to get coffee with me later that day. During our conversation, I asked for her feedback about my project. I realized she was planning on using the same archive as me to support her research and had concerns regarding the availability of the space and resources. I reassured her that she would have access as well, and together we created a schedule that worked for the both of us."

17.Describe a moment where you failed?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>

Sample Answer: “When I started my first internship, I was overly eager to go the extra mile. I agreed to take on unrealistic deadlines with coworkers. I was late completing at least one task each week, and my coworkers were not happy with me. After that experience, I devised a tracking system to make sure I knew how long each task would realistically take and made sure never to fall behind again. I understand now that it’s better to give a longer timeline and be early than promise the moon and fail to deliver.”
