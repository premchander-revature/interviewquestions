<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample answer 1: At my current job, a client called late Friday afternoon with an urgent question about their project status. Usually my boss directly interacts with our clients, but he'd already left for the weekend. I told the client that while I might not know the exact answer, I could possibly help because I was also working on the project. The client was fine with that. We worked through the question together, and I was able to provide enough information that the client felt the rest could wait until Monday. I left a detailed note for my boss asking him to check in with the client on Monday.

Sample answer 2: When the software development of our new product stalled, I coordinated the team that managed to get the schedule back on track. We were able to successfully troubleshoot the issues and solve the problems, within a very short period, and without completely burning out our team. I was able to do this by motivating the senior engineering team to brainstorm a technologically innovative solution that would solve the customer’s issues with fewer development hours on our end.

3.How did you deal with someone not pulling their weight?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample answer 1: I had a colleague who always wanted things done his way, invariably getting into confrontations with many co-workers. I had to team up with him on a month-long social media campaign to develop creative post ideas and strategically schedule them for maximum reach and engagement. I was tactful and kept my cool throughout. When we disagreed, I heard him out. If I still believed that my idea was better, I supported it with enough data and proven theories to convince him. Ultimately, the campaign was a success, and my colleague came to respect me greatly.

Sample answer 2: A team member was finding it difficult to contribute because they were unclear as to what their role was. I helped resolve the situation by creating a more detailed work plan that specified each member's role and responsibilities on the project.

5.Tell me about your previous job experience?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample answer 1: Most of my professional experience has led me up to this administrative secretary role. I’ve been working in the field for almost ten years now. I got my first position as an office assistant when I was 18 – a position that required a lot of communication with both co-workers and customers. I’m interested in this position specifically because it would allow me to expand my leadership potential and continue working in an environment that I have a great deal of experience in.

Sample answer 2: The last time I worked as a language assistant, I found the work interesting but sometimes hard. I learned a lot from my work experience. On one occasion I found two boys fighting in the playground. I managed to calm them down by being calm myself. I asked them what had happened and helped them to resolve their fight themselves. I thought that in a situation like that I would get angry myself, and perhaps take sides, but I did not.  I think that this was a great lesson for me.

6.Describe a problem that you had and how did you fix it?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample answer 1: I feel that the best way to deal with any challenges is to meet them head-on. When I found that one of my colleagues was saying things that weren't true behind my back, I went to them and talked it through. It turned out they had misunderstood what I had said, and I was able to set the record straight with them, and my supervisor.

Sample answer 2: Once I found a major flaw in the work of one of the most senior members of the department, which could have been very costly to the company if it had been overlooked. I went directly to them and called it to their attention so they could fix it before it affected the outcome.

7.How would you handle a client situation where the client was upset with a broken code and the client claimed that you submitted but it was another team member's code?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
•	Empathy is key
•	Saying Sorry
•	Own up and explain what went wrong
If you are an ethical and empathetic person you own up to this and let the chips fall where they may. You need to ensure that when you notify your client of the fault, you also inform them of how this mistake occurred and how it will never occur again with documented changes in processes and tests to catch any similar issue in the future. Even though the broken code is from is from someone else and you are not at fault, do not come up with reasons defending your part. Instead, try to take responsibility and come up with solutions to resolve this problem. That way, you portray yourself as a good and responsible team player.

12.Tell me about a time when you had to use a creative solution to solve a problem while working with others.

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
1. Define the (right) problem
2. Check your mindset
3. Empathize with the players
4. Connect with your purpose
5. Generate ideas
6. Make small bets
7. Get feedback/evaluate options
8. Start again
Sample answer: In my last job, I had to do quite a bit of problem solving related to our shift scheduling. We had four people quit within a week and the department was severely understaffed. I coordinated a ramp-up of our hiring efforts, I got approval from the department head to offer bonuses for overtime work, and then I found eight employees who were willing to do overtime this month. I think the key problem-solving skills here were taking initiative, communicating clearly, and reacting quickly to solve this problem before it became an even bigger issue.

13.Talk about a time when you had an issue with a coworker, how did you resolve that?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample answer 1: Once, a co-worker and I disagreed on the way an unsatisfied customer was dealt with. I decided to meet with them one on one to talk and resolve our dispute in a peaceful manner. We both agreed that our goal was to keep the customer happy and came to a compromise that consisted of both of our ideas.

Sample answer 2: I’ve learned that disagreements and conflicts are part of work whether I like it or not. I’ve also learned that, without conflict, there’s no progress. So, if a conflict arises, that means there’s room for progress and scope for improvement in that space. I must tread carefully and take it slowly so as not to offend others or complicate circumstances. I take enough time to assess the situation and once I gain a clear understanding of the situation, I will take care of them to resolve the conflict.

14.If you were asked to switch roles in the company, how would you handle that?

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
Sample answer 1: When I was promoted from salesclerk to store manager, I was nervous about the changes that would come along with my transition into a leadership role. There have been moments in my career when I have looked to others to act as leaders because I was intimidated by the responsibility of managing a team. I overcame that fear, and through my strong leadership and interpersonal skills, we received a good rating of employee satisfaction on our most recent survey.

Sample answer 2: I manage change by first seeking to understand the reason for the change. I then immediately changed as needed to support the workplace and my team. As someone who seeks ways to improve my work environment, I welcome change.

15.Talk about a time when you thought you did your best, but it did not work out.

<details>
<summary> Show Answer </summary>
<blockquote>
 
The best way to answer this question is to talk about a specific example of a time you made a mistake: Briefly explain what the mistake was, but don't dwell on it. Quickly switch over to what you learned or how you improved, after making that mistake.

Sample Answer: One thing I have learned from past mistakes is when to ask for help. I have learned that it is far better to ask for clarification and solve an issue right away than to be unsure. I know that your company emphasizes teamwork and the need to be in constant communication with one another, and I think my ability to ask (and answer) questions of my peers would help me fit in very well with your company culture.
