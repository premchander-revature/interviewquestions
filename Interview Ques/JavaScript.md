Here in the example we will get a message x is `undefined` which means the variable x is declared and memory is created but the value is not assigned to it.

<code> console.log(y) </code>

In this case, you will get a message like `not defined` because the variable y is not created, and memory is not allocated for it and we try to reference the variable.

The `typeof` is a unary operator which takes a single operand in a statement, it is used to check the data type of its operand in the form of a string for example if we check the variable which is undefined then the `typeof` will return values as `undefined`.

``` java
var x=15;
console.log(typeof (x))
```

It will print the number 15 in the console

<code>
var x = 15;
console.log(typeof (y) == 'number')
</code>

From the above code if the `typeof` y is a number, so from the expression it will print true in the console.
