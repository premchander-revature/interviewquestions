10. How will you differentiate between `a=a+b` and `a+=b`?p1

 ![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>

<blockquote>

- The `a=a+b` statement has an assignment operator `=` and a arithmetic operator ` + ` , while `a+=b` has a arithmetic assignment operator `+=`. 

- For similar integer or byte or float data types both the expressions would compile.

- But if one value(a) is byte and the other(b) is int, `a=a+b` will not compile as ` byte+int ` is not byte

- Whereas `a+=b` will compile as the arithmetic assignment operator will do an implicit type casting.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>

<blockquote>

In Java, when a package is imported, its sub-packages aren’t imported and developer needs to import them separately if required.

For example, if a developer imports a package `Company.*,` all classes in the package named Company are loaded but no classes from the sub-package are loaded. To load the classes from its sub-package ( say team), developer has to import it explicitly as follows:

`import Company.team.*`

The above program will give a compile-time error. The compiler will throw 2 errors in this.

- `[Illegal Combination of modifiers: abstract and final] at line 1.`
- `[Cannot inherit from final ‘InterviewBit’] at line 4.`
- Abstract classes are incomplete classes that need to be inherited for creating their concrete classes,  the final keywords in class are used for avoiding inheritance. So these combinations are not allowed in Java.
