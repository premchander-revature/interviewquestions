There are two ways to declare a String in Java

Using `string` literal: Double quotes are used to create Java String literals. 
Example: `String str= "Welcome"; ` 
Using `new` keyword: Keyword `new` is used to create a Java string.
Example: `String str=new String ( "Welcome");`

<details><summary><b> Show Answer </b></summary>

 Strings are Java objects that represent sequences of characters. String objects are created using the `java.lang.String class`. There are many functions to be invoked when processing a string, such as `substring()`, `indexof()`, `equals()`, `toUppercase()`, etc, which primitives types do not have.

- In Java both the `equals()` method and the `==` operator compares the objects.

- The `==` operator can be used for comparing references (addresses) and the `.equals()` method can be used to compare the content.
`==` checks if the objects point to the same memory location, whereas `.equals()` compares the values of the objects.

<details><summary><b> Explanation </b></summary>

<blockquote>

Strings are immutable objects,so they can't be changed or altered once created. As a result, whenever we manipulate a String object, it creates a new String rather than modifying the original string object. In Java, every immutable object is thread-safe, which means String is also thread-safe in Java.
