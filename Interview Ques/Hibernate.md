There are 3 states of the object (instance) in hibernate.

- Transient: The object is in a transient state if it is just created but has no primary key (identifier) and not associated with a session.
- Persistent: The object is in a persistent state if a session is open, and you just saved the instance in the database or retrieved the instance from the database.
- Detached: The object is in a detached state if a session is closed. After detached state, the object comes to persistent state if you call `lock()` or `update()` method.
