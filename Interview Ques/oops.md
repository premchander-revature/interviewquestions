69. Can a class be a super class and a sub-class at the same time? Give example.p1

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> Show Answer </summary>

 Yes, If there is a hierarchy of inheritance used, a class can be a super class for another class and a sub-class for another one at the same time.
 
 Example : 

 ```java

 public class Animal{
..........
}
public class Cat extends Animal {
............
}
public class Kitten extends Cat {
......................
