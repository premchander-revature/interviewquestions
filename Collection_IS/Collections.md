1. What does the Collections framework in Java contain?

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

2. Can you tell the main interfaces, and what are the differences between them?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Set, List and Map are three important interfaces of the Java collection framework.
- A List can be used when the insertion order of elements needs to be maintained.
- We can use a set if we need to maintain a collection that contains no duplicates.
- And Map when data is key-value pairs and need fast retrieval of value based on some key.

3. Why is Map not inherited from the Collection interface, despite the fact that it is a component of the Java collection framework? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Because they are of an incompatible type. List, Set and Queue are a collection of similar kind of objects but just values where a Map is a collection of key and value pairs.

4. How do you remove an entry from a collection? And subsequently, what is the difference between the `remove()` method of a collection and the `remove()` method of an iterator? Which one will you use while removing elements during iteration?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

- Collection interface defines `remove(Object obj)` method to remove objects from `Collection.List` interface adds another method `remove(int index)`, which is used to remove objects at a specific index.
- You can use any of these methods to remove an entry from Collection, while not iterating. 
- Things change when you iterate. Suppose you are traversing a List and removing only certain elements based on logic, then you need to use Iterator's `remove()` method. 
-This method removes the current element from Iterator's perspective. If you use Collection's or List's `remove()` method during iteration then your code will throw `ConcurrentModificationException`. 
- That's why it's advised to use the iterator `remove()` method to remove objects from Collection.

5. How does HashSet use Hashing?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

HashSet extends `AbstractSet` and implements the Set interface. It creates a collection that uses a hash table for storage. A hash table stores information by using a mechanism called hashing. In hashing, the informational content of a key is used to determine a unique value, called its hash code.

6. How is HashSet implemented in Java?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

When we create an object of HashSet, it internally creates an instance of HashMap with default initial capacity 16. HashSet uses a constructor `HashSet(int capacity)` that represents how many elements can be stored in the HashSet. The capacity may increase automatically when more elements to be store.

7. Which one do you prefer in Java between Array and Array Lists for storing objects and why?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Though ArrayList is also backed up by array, it offers some usability advantage over array in Java.Array is fixed length data structure, once created you can not change it's length. On the other hand,ArrayList is dynamic, it automatically allocate a new array and copies content of old array, when it resize.Another reason of using ArrayList over Array is support of Generics.

<blockquote>

- No, Collection is a top level interface of Java collection framework where as Collections is an utility class. Below table shows the difference between them.

- Collection:	
    - Collection is a root level interface of the Java Collection Framework. 
    - Most of the classes in Java Collection Framework inherit from this interface.	
    - List, Set and Queue are main sub interfaces of this interface.	

- Collections:
    - Collections is an utility class in java.util package. 
    - It consists of only static methods which are used to operate on objects of type Collection.

24. Why is it recommended not to use the Vector class in our code?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Vector class is preferred over ArrayList class when you are developing a multi threaded application. 
But, precautions need to be taken because vector may reduce the performance of your application as it is 
thread safe and only one thread is allowed to have object lock at any moment of time and remaining threads have to wait until a thread releases the object lock. So, it is always recommended that if you don’t need thread safe environment, it is better to use ArrayList class than the Vector class.And also Vector class is often considered as obsolete or “Due for Deprecation” by many experienced Java developers. They always recommend and advise not to use Vector class in your code. They prefer using ArrayList over Vector class.

33. What is the purpose of the initial capacity and load factor parameters of a HashMap? What are
their default values? How is the threshold plays the role to decide the size?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
<blockquote>

Initial capacity in HashMap plays a vital role in the allocation of memory as we know that HashMap works on the key-value pair, that means the HashMap needed a large amount of memory to maintain the key and value, to overcome these challenges the HashMap works on the principal to allocate the optimum size, whenever the HashMap get instantiated, that is called Initial capacity, which is usually a 16.

Now let’s focus on load factor, so there is a concept of threshold value, which is always a 0.75 size of the total capacity, the significance of this is whenever any new record gets inserted in the HashMap, the HashMap computes the allocated size of the HashMap, then it checks whether this size reaches the threshold value then HashMap increased the size of 75% from the current size to augmented the storage for next incoming record.

Advantages of using `emptySet()` method over creating object using constructor are :

1. Immutable : You should prefer to use immutable collection against the mutable collections wherever possible . It becomes handy as multiple threads accessing the same instance of object will see the same values.

2. Concise :  You do not need to manually type out the generic type of the collection - normally it is inferred from the context of the method call.


3. Efficient : As `emptySet()` method dont create new objects , so they just reuse the  existing empty and immutable object . Although ,practically,this trick is not that handy , and rarely improves the performance

A good way to sort Java collection objects is using Comparable and Comparator interfaces. A developer can use `Collections.sort()`, the elements are sorted based on the order mention in `compareTo()`.

When a developer uses Collections, sort (Comparator), it sorts the objects depend on `compare()` of the Comparator interface.
