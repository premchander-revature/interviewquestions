<blockquote markdown="1"> 
    
- A blue/green deployment is an application deployment strategy.
- First, we create two separate, but identical environments.
- One environment (blue) is running the current application version and one environment (green) is running the new application version.
- Using a blue/green deployment strategy increases application availability and reduces deployment risk by simplifying the rollback process if a deployment fails.
- Once testing has been completed on the green environment, live application traffic is directed to the green environment and the blue environment is deprecated.
