1.Do we need to set the path for Java?

A.Yes
B.No

Answer:B
Explanation:We need tools like Javac, Java, etc., which are located in the JDK/bin directory to compile and run Java programs.Before compiling and running a Java program, we need to set the path. This informs where JDK packages are installed.
Note: We don't need to set the path if we save the Java source file inside the JDK\bin directory.

3. Do we need to set the environment variable?

A.Yes
B.No

Answer:A
Explanation:Whenever we run any command in the terminal, the prompt will check for the relevant executable file present in the current directory or in system environment variables.When we compile a Java program by running Javac MyPrg.Java command in the terminal, it will look for the Javac.exe file to compile.If current directory is not C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91\bin (where Javac.exe present), we'll get Javac is not recognized error.One of the way to avoid this error is by setting the Java path C:\ProgramFiles\Java\jdk1.8.0_05\bin in environment variables.

7. State True or False: Java is platform-dependent language.

A.True
B.False

Answer:B
Explanation:Java is platform independent language.By use of compiler, .Java file is converted into .class. Java Runtime Environment is supported by many platforms which contains JVM. Java Virtual Machine is responsible to convert .class into native bytecode.

8.State True or False: main() is the entry point of a Java program?

A.False
B.True

Answer:B
Explanation:When Java Virtual Machine runs, it will find the main method which is in the form of public static void main(String[] args). It is not found in the Java application, the Java application will not be executed. If the method signature or passing parameter of main method is changed, it will not be consider as staring point.

12.Can we have two public classes in the same file?

A.Yes.
B.No.

Answer:B
Explanation:No, We can have more classes in a file but only one class should be public.It makes the compilation faster by efficient lookup of code. If you have more than one public class, the error will be generated on compilation time.

15.State True or False: Size of int in Java is the same 4 bytes for both 32 bit and 64 bit architecture.

A.False
B.True

Answer:B
Explanation:Software that is designed without regard to the target platform.  Software is often written to maximize the performance of a specific hardware platform, but such software must be modified to make it run on other hardware.Example: Size of int in C is 2 bytes for 32 bit architecture and 4 bytes for 64 bit architecture. Size of int in Java is the same 4 bytes for both 32 bit and 64 bit architecture.

16.What is the full form of JIT?

A.Just in Time.
B.Just in Thread.
C.Java in Time.
D.Java in Thread.

Answer:A
Explanation:In Just In Time compilation, the source code is coverted into byte code. Where the bytecode is platform independant. It is runnable in different architecture system when it is coverted in machine code in that system. Here,some of the frequently used codes are stored as code cache and used when it's required.In Ahead Of Time compilation, the souce code is directly converted into machine.So,it is platform dependant. AOT is used for to manual machine code convertion.

21.State True or False: Can we call the Java programing as pure object oriented if we use wrapper class instead of primitive data type?

A.False
B.True

Answer:A
Explanation:When we use wrapper class while using arithmatic operations between two values there will be unboxing and auto boxing. Unboxing means converting object into primitive datatype and auto boxing means,converting primitive into object which also deals with primitives. So, Java is not pure object oriented when we use wrapper class also.
