4.Predict the output for the following code snippet?

class Main{
 public static void main(String[] args){
  int a=1;
		System.out.println(2*a++ + 5 + a);
		System.out.println(a++ + ++a + ++a);
}
}

A.10 11
B.9 12
C.9 11
D.10 12

Answer:C
Explanation:In postincreament the value is holded then it will be increamented. In preincrement the value is increamented on code flow itself. In first line of output (2*1)+5+2=9 The value of a is 1 and then increamented to 2 In second line of output 2+4+5 = 11 Initially the value of a is 2 and then increamented to 3, in pre increament the value will be 4 and 5.

The numbers are allowed for variable that should not used at begining. No special characters are used for variable declaration. The variable consisting one word should be in lower case.Example: address, email. If it consists two words or more, it should have name first letter of first word in lower case and first letter of upcoming words should be in upper case Example: phoneNumber.If the variable is constant, the letters of the variable should be in capital and words seperated by uderscore_.Example: static final int DEPARTMENT_ID = 230.
