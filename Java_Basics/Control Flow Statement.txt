3.Predict the output if the value = 10.

public static int toPositive(int value) {
  	if(value<0) {
  		return -value;
  	}
  	return value;
  }
A.null.
B.-10.
C.No output.
D.10.

Answer:D
Explanation: Since the value is 10, it will not enter the if block and return the value as it is.

4.Predict the output of the code below if value=200.

public static int findPrice(int value) {
  int price ;
  if(value<100) {
  	price = value;
  }
  else if(value<300) {
  	price = value*2;
  }
  else {
  	price = value*5;
  }
  return price;
}

A.200
B.400
C.1000
D.Compilation Error

Answer:B
Explanation: Since the given value is 200, which is not lesser than 100 so it will skip the first if block and enters the else block and it is lesser than 200. So, price will be doubled.

5.When we will get the output 'pass' according to the code snippet given below.

public static String findMonth(int english,int math,int science) {
		String result = null;
		if(english>=35) {
			if(math>=35) {
				if(science>=35) {
					result="Pass";
				}
			}
		}
		else {
			result="Fail";
		}
		return result;
	}
A.english>=35 && math>=35 && science<=35
B.english<=35 && math>=35 && science>=35
C.english<=35 && math>=35 && science<=35
D.english>=35 && math>=35 && science>=35

Answer:D
Explanation: All the three if conditions should be true then only the result will be true.This code is an example of nested if else statement.
