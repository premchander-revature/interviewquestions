<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
  
First, we will implement the service strategy state where we will plan which type of mall we want to build, what services we will provide in that mall, and what can be the main attraction for the customers in that mall. 
In service design, we will create an on-paper layout for the design. 
In service transition, we will do the physical implementation of the design finalized in the service design stage. 
In the service operation stage, we will monitor if the selling operation is executed without any errors and if all the products are properly packed. Following our observations, we discovered that if a product is not in high demand, removing it from the list and improving service quality through feedback will fall under the Continual Service Improvement stage.
