3.How do you create a servlet in a web application?p1

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

We have to create a Java class that extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet and import the classes from servlet.jar or servlet-api.jar.These will be needed to compile the servlet.A servlet does not have a main() method, unlike a regular Java program, and just like an applet. It has some methods of a servlet that are called upon by the server for the purpose of handling requests. It invokes the servlet’s service() method, every time the server sends a request to a servlet.

To handle requests that are appropriate for the servlet, a typical servlet must override its service() method. The service() method allows 2 parameters: these are the request object and the response object. The request object is used to inform the servlet about the request, whereas the response object is used to then give a response.

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>


Servlets init method is used to initialise a servlet.When the web container loads and instantiates the servlet class and before it delivers requests from clients, the web container initializes the servlet. To customize this process to allow the servlet to read persistent configuration data, initialize resources, and perform any other one-time activities, you override the init method of the Servlet interface.When a servlet container determines that a servlet should be removed from service (for example, when a container wants to reclaim memory resources or when it is being shut down), the container calls the destroy method of the Servlet interface.

9.Explain the Life Cycle of a Servlet?p1

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- The life cycle of a servlet can be implemented by `init( )`, `service( )`, and `destroy( )` methods.
When a user enters a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to a web browser.The browser then generates an HTTP request for this URL. This request is then sent to the appropriate server.The Http request is received by the web server. The server maps this request to a particular servlet. 

- The servlet is dynamically retrieved and loaded into the address space of the server.The server invokes the `init( )` method of the servlet. This method is invoked only when the servlet is first loaded into memory. It is possible to pass initialization parameters to the servlet so it may configure itself.

- The server invokes the `service( )` method of the servlet. This method is called to process the HTTP request. You will see that it is possible for the servlet to read data that has been provided in the HTTP request. It may also formulate an HTTP response for the client.The servlet remains in the server’s address space and is available to process any other HTTP requests received from clients. The `service( )` method is called for each HTTP request.

- The server may decide to unload the servlet from its memory. The server calls the` destroy( )`method to relinquish any resources such as file handles that are allocated for the servlet. Important data may be saved to a persistent store. The memory allocated for the servlet and its objects can then be garbage collected.

<blockquote>

In servlet reloading, the objects in classloader are developed to load a class just once. To solve this limitation and to load servlets multiple times, servers use custom class loaders. These custom class loaders load servlets from the default servlets directory.When a server dispatches a request to a servlet, it first checks if the servlet’s class file has changed on disk. If the change appears, then the server abandons the class that the loader used to load the old version and then creates a new instance of the custom class loader to load the new version. Old servlet versions can stay in memory indefinitely, but the old versions are not used to handle any more requests

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

- We can create and compile the servlet source code.Then, copy the servlet’s class file to the proper directory, and add the servlet’s name and mappings to the proper web.xml file.
- Start Tomcat.
- Start a web browser and request the servlet.

```java

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
public class HelloServlet extends GenericServlet {
public void service(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)throws ServletException, IOException {
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter pw = response.getWriter();
pw.println("<b>Hello!");
pw.close();
}
}

```

<details><summary><b> Explanation </b></summary>

The `javax.servlet` package contains the classes and interfaces required to build servlets.The program defines HelloServlet as a subclass of GenericServlet. The GenericServlet class provides functionality that simplifies the creation of a servlet. For example, it provides versions of `init( )` and `destroy( )` methods, which may be used to it. You need to supply only the `service( )` method.The `service( )` method which is inherited from GenericServlet is overridden. This method handles requests from a client. 
ServletRequest object enables the servlet to read data that is provided via the client request. ServletResponse object enables the servlet to formulate a response for the client.The call to `setContentType( )` establishes the MIME type of the Http response and the MIME type is text/html. This indicates that the browser should interpret the content as html source code. The `getWriter( )` method obtains a PrintWriter. Anything written to this stream is sent to the client as part of the http response. Then `println( )` is used to write some simple html source code as the http response. Compile this source code and place the HelloServlet.class file in the proper Tomcat directory and add HelloServlet to the web.xml file,Start the Tomcat and it must be running before you try to execute a servlet.Start a Web Browser and Request the Servlet.Start a web browser and enter the URL shown below:
`http://localhost:8080/servlets-examples/servlet/HelloServlet` and also `http://127.0.0.1:8080/servletsexamples/servlet/HelloServlet`
This can be done because 127.0.0.1 is defined as the IP address of the local machine.
The output of the servlet is shown in the browser display area. It will contain the
string Hello! in bold type.

13.Explain Single-Thread Model in servlets?p2

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

It is standard to have a single servlet instance for each registered name of the servlet. However, instead of this, it is also possible for a servlet to choose to have a pool of instances created for each of its names that all share the task of handling requests. These servlets indicate this action by implementing the `javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel` interface.
A server loading the SingleThreadModel servlet should guarantee, "that no two threads will execute concurrently the service method of that servlet". Each thread uses a free servlet instance from the pool in order to achieve this. Therefore, any servlet using the SingleThreadModel isn’t needed to synchronize usage to its instance variables and is considered thread-safe.

The ServletConfig interface allows a servlet to obtain configuration data when it is loaded.
The methods declared by this interface are given below:

- `ServletContext getServletContext( )`: It returns the context for this servlet.
- `String getInitParameter(String param)`:It returns the value of the initialization parameter named param.
- `String getServletName( )`:It returns the name of the invoking servlet.

The ServletContext interface enables servlets to obtain information about their environment.

- `void destroy( )`: It is Called when the servlet is unloaded.
- `ServletConfig getServletConfig( )`: It returns a ServletConfig object that contains any initialization
parameters.
- `String getServletInfo( )`: It returns a string describing the servlet.
- `void init(ServletConfig sc)throws ServletException`:It is invoked when the servlet is initialized. Initialization parameters for the servlet can be obtained from sc.An UnavailableException should be thrown if the servlet cannot be initialized.
- `void service(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res)throws ServletException,IOException`:It is used to process a request from a client. The request from the client can be read from req. The response to the clientcan be written to res. An exception is generated if a servlet or IO problem occurs.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

The ServletRequest interface includes methods that allow you to read the names and values of parameters that are included in a client request.The example contains two files. A web page is defined in parameters.htm, and
a servlet is defined in parametersservlet.java.

The html source code for parameters.htm is shown in the following listing. It defines
a table that contains two labels and two text fields. One of the labels is Employee and the
other is Phone. There is also a submit button. Notice that the action parameter of the form
tag specifies a url. The url identifies the servlet to process the http post request.

```java

<html>
<body>
<center>
<form name="Form1"method="post" action="http://localhost:8080/servlets-examples/servlet/parametersservlet">
<table>
<tr>
<td><B>Employee</td>
<td><input type=textbox name="e" size="20" value=""></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><B>Phone</td>
<td><input type=textbox name="p" size="20" value=""></td>
</tr>
</table>
<input type=submit value="Submit">
</body>
</html>

```

The source code for parametersservlet.java is shown in the following listing. The `service( )` method is overridden to process client requests. The `getParameterNames( )` method returns an enumeration of the parameter names. These are processed in a loop. You can see that the parameter name and value are output to the client. The parameter value is obtained via the `getParameter( )` method.

```java

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

A servlet can write a cookie to a user’s machine by using `addCookie( )` method of the HttpServletResponse interface. The data for that cookie is then included in the header of the http response that is sent to the browser. The names and values of cookies are stored on the user’s machine. Some of the information that is saved for each cookie includes the following:

- The name of the cookie
- The value of the cookie
- The expiration date of the cookie
- The domain and path of the cookie

The expiration date determines when this cookie is deleted from the user’s machine. If an expiration date is not explicitly assigned to a cookie, it is deleted when the current browser session ends. Otherwise, the cookie is saved in a file on the user’s machine.The domain and path of the cookie determine when it is included in the header of an HTTP request. If the user enters a URL whose domain and path match these values, the cookie is then supplied to the Web server. Otherwise, it is not.
There is one constructor for Cookie. It has the signature shown here: `Cookie(String name, String value)`
Here, the name and value of the cookie are supplied as arguments to the constructor

29:Explain how it is possible to handle HTTP Requests in a servlet with examples?p1

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

The HttpServlet class provides specialized methods that handle the various types of http requests. A servlet developer typically overrides one of these methods. These methods are `doDelete( )`, `doGet( )`, `doHead( )`, `doOptions( )`, `doPost( )`, `doPut( )`, and `doTrace( )`. However, the GET and POST requests are commonly used when handling form input. 

- Handling HTTP GET Requests:We will develop a servlet that handles an HTTP GET request. The servlet is invoked when a form on a web page is submitted. The example contains two files. A web page is definedin ColorGet.htm, and a servlet is defined in ColorGetServlet.java. The HTML source code for ColorGet.htm is shown below. It defines a form that contains a select element and a submit button. Notice that the action parameter of the form tag specifies a URL. The URL identifies a servlet to process the HTTP GET request.

```java

<html>
<body>
<center>
<form name="Form1"
action="http://localhost:8080/servlets-examples/servlet/ColorGetServlet">
<B>Color:</B>
<select name="color" size="1">
<option value="Red">Red</option>
<option value="Green">Green</option>
<option value="Blue">Blue</option>
</select>
<br><br>
<input type=submit value="Submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>

```
The source code for ColorGetServlet.java is shown in the following listing. The doGet( ) method is overridden to process any HTTP GET requests that are sent to this servlet. It uses the getParameter( ) method of HttpServletRequest to obtain the selection that was made by the user. A response is then formulated.

```java

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
public class ColorGetServlet extends HttpServlet {
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response)throws ServletException, IOException {
String color = request.getParameter("color");
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter pw = response.getWriter();
pw.println("<B>The selected color is: ");
pw.println(color);
pw.close();
}
}

```

- Handling HTTP POST Requests:We will develop a servlet that handles an HTTP POST request. The servlet is invoked when a form on a web page is submitted. The example contains two files. A web page is defined in ColorPost.htm, and a servlet is defined in ColorPostServlet.java.The HTML source code for ColorPost.htm is shown below. It is identical to ColorGet.htm except that the method parameter for the form tag explicitly specifies that the POST method should be used, and the action parameter for the form tag specifies a
different servlet.

```java

<html>
<body>
<center>
<form name="Form1"
method="post"
action="http://localhost:8080/servlets-examples/servlet/ColorPostServlet">
<B>Color:</B>
<select name="color" size="1">
<option value="Red">Red</option>
<option value="Green">Green</option>
<option value="Blue">Blue</option>
</select>
<br><br>
<input type=submit value="Submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>

```
The source code for ColorPostServlet.java is shown below. The `doPost( )` method is overridden to process any HTTP POST requests that are sent to this servlet. It uses the `getParameter( )` method of HttpServletRequest to obtain the selection that was made
by the user. A response is then formulated.

```java

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
public class ColorPostServlet extends HttpServlet {
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response)throws ServletException, IOException {
String color = request.getParameter("color");
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter pw = response.getWriter();
pw.println("<B>The selected color is: ");
pw.println(color);
pw.close();

The source code for AddCookieServlet.java is shown below. It gets the value of the parameter named "data". It then creates a Cookie object that has the name "MyCookie" and contains the value of the "data" parameter. The cookie is then added to the header of the http response via the `addCookie( )` method.

```java

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
public class AddCookieServlet extends HttpServlet {
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response)throws ServletException, IOException {
String data = request.getParameter("data");
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("MyCookie", data);
response.addCookie(cookie);
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter pw = response.getWriter();
pw.println("<B>MyCookie has been set to");
pw.println(data);
pw.close();
}
}

```

The source code for GetCookiesServlet.java is shown below. It invokes the `getCookies( )` method to read any cookies that are included in the HTTP GET request. The names and values of these cookies are then written to the HTTP response. Observe that the
`getName( )` and `getValue( )` methods are called to obtain this information.

```java

import java.io.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
public class GetCookiesServlet extends HttpServlet {
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response)throws ServletException, IOException {
Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter pw = response.getWriter();
pw.println("<B>");
for(int i = 0; i < cookies.length; i++) {
String name = cookies[i].getName();
String value = cookies[i].getValue();
pw.println("name = " + name +"; value = " + value);
}
pw.close();
}
}

31:What is Session Tracking?p1

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

Http is a stateless protocol. Each request is independent of the previous one. However, in some applications, it is necessary to save state information so that information can be collected from several interactions between a browser and a server. Sessions provide such a mechanism.A session can be created via the `getSession( )` method of HttpServletRequest. An HttpSession object is returned. This object can store a set of bindings that associate names with objects. The `setAttribute( )`, `getAttribute( )`, `getAttributeNames( )`, and `removeAttribute( )` methods of HttpSession manage these bindings.

32.How do you create session using session tracking in servlets?p1

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary><b> Show Answer</b></summary>

<blockquote>

A new session is created if one does not already exist. The `getAttribute( )`method is called to obtain the object that is bound to the name "date". That object is a Date object that encapsulates the date and time when this page was last accessed. A Date object encapsulating the current date and time is then created. The `setAttribute( )` method is called to bind the name "date"
to this object.

```java

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.*;
public class DateServlet extends HttpServlet {
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,HttpServletResponse response)throws ServletException, IOException {
HttpSession hs = request.getSession(true);
response.setContentType("text/html");
PrintWriter pw = response.getWriter();
pw.print("<B>");
Date date = (Date)hs.getAttribute("date");
if(date != null) {
pw.print("Last access: " + date + "<br>");
}
date = new Date();
hs.setAttribute("date", date);
pw.println("Current date: " + date);
}
}

```

When you first request this servlet, the browser displays one line with the current date and time information. On subsequent invocations, two lines are displayed. The first line shows the date and time when the servlet was last accessed. The second line shows the current date and time.
