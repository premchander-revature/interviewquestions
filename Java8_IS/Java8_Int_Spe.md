<blockquote>

- No, for defining default method inside interface `default` keyword is must and it should prefix method declaration.
- Without prefixing default keyword results in compilation error.
- **Compile-time error**: Abstract methods do not specify a body.
- **Reason**: without default keyword, compiler consider it as abstract method which doesnâ€™t have body.
