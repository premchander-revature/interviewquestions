<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- The following are the main components of AWS are:
  - Simple Storage Service: S3 is a service of aws that stores the files. It is object-based storage, i.e., you can store the images, word files, pdf files, etc. The size of the file that can be stored in S3 is from 0 Bytes to 5 TB. It is an unlimited storage medium, i.e., you can store the data as much you want. S3 contains a bucket which stores the files. A bucket is like a folder that stores the files. It is a universal namespace, i.e., name must be unique globally. Each bucket must have a unique name to generate the unique DNS address.
    o Elastic Compute Cloud: Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can scale the compute capacity up and down as per the computing requirement changes. It changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for the resources that you actually use.
    o Elastic Block Store: It provides a persistent block storage volume for use with EC2 instances in aws cloud. EBS volume is automatically replicated within its availability zone to prevent the component failure. It offers high durability, availability, and low-latency performance required to run your workloads.
    o CloudWatch: It is a service which is used to monitor all the AWS resources and applications that you run in real time. It collects and tracks the metrics that measure your resources and applications. If you want to know about the CloudWatch in detail, then click on the below link: Click here
    o Identity Access Management: It is a service of aws used to manage users and their level of access to the aws management console. It is used to set users, permissions, and roles. It allows you to grant permission to the different parts of the aws platform. If you want to know about the IAM, then click the below link: Click here
    o Simple Email Service: Amazon Simple Email Service is a cloud-based email sending service that helps digital marketers and application developers to send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. This service is very reliable and cost-effective for the businesses of all the sizes that want to keep in touch with the customers.
    o Route53: It is a highly available and scalable DNS (Domain Name Service) service. It provides a reliable and cost-effective way for the developers and businesses to route end users to internet applications by translating domain names into numeric IP addresses.

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- Auto Scaling is a feature in aws that automatically scales the capacity to maintain steady and predictable performance. While using auto scaling, you can scale multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. If you are already using Amazon EC2 Auto- scaling, then you can combine Amazon EC2 Auto-Scaling with the Auto-Scaling to scale additional resources for other AWS services.

  Benefits of Auto Scaling
  o Setup Scaling Quickly:
  It sets the target utilization levels of multiple resources in a single interface. You can see the average utilization level of multiple resources in the same console, i.e., you do not have to move to the different console.
  o Make Smart Scaling Decisions:
  It makes the scaling plans that automate how different resources respond to the changes. It optimizes the availability and cost. It automatically creates the scaling policies and sets the targets based on your preference. It also monitors your application and automatically adds or removes the capacity based on the requirements.
  o Automatically maintain performance:
  Auto Scaling automatically optimize the application performance and availability even when the workloads are unpredictable. It continuously monitors your application to maintain the desired performance level. When demand rises, then Auto Scaling automatically scales the resources.

13. How can you secure the access to your S3 bucket?

![Easy](<https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg>)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- S3 bucket can be secured in two ways:

o ACL (Access Control List):
ACL is used to manage the access of resources to buckets and objects. An object of each bucket is associated with ACL. It defines which AWS accounts have granted access and the type of access. When a user sends the request for a resource, then its corresponding ACL will be checked to verify whether the user has granted access to the resource or not.

    When you create a bucket, then Amazon S3 creates a default ACL which provides a full control over the AWS resources.

o Bucket Policies
Bucket policies are only applied to S3 bucket. Bucket policies define what actions are allowed or denied. Bucket policies are attached to the bucket not to an S3 object but the permissions define in the bucket policy are applied to all the objects in S3 bucket.

    The following are the main elements of Bucket policy:

    o	Sid: A Sid determines what the policy will do. For example, if an action that needs to be performed is adding a new user to an Access Control List (ACL), then the Sid would be AddCannedAcl. If the policy is defined to evaluate IP addresses, then the Sid would be IPAllow.

    o	Effect: An effect defines an action after applying the policy. The action could be either to allow an action or to deny an action.

    o	Principal: A Principal is a string that determines to whom the policy is applied. If we set the principal string as '*', then the policy is applied to everyone, but it is also possible that you can specify individual AWS account.

    o	Action: An Action is what happens when the policy is applied. For example, s3:Getobject is an action that allows to read object data.

    o	Resource: The Resource is a S3 bucket to which the statement is applied. You cannot enter a simply bucket name, you need to specify the bucket name in a specific format. For example, the bucket name is javatpoint-bucket, then the resource would be written as "arn:aws:s3""javatpoint-bucket/*".

14. What are policies and what are the different types of policies?

![Easy](<https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg>)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- Policy is an object which is associated with a resource that defines the permissions. AWS evaluate these policies when user makes a request. Permissions in the policy determine whether to allow or to deny an action. Policies are stored in the form of a JSON documents.

AWS supports six types of policies:
o Identity-based policies
o Resource-based policies
o Permissions boundaries
o Organizations SCPs
o Access Control Lists
o Session policies
  
![AWS policies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110088496/194527269-0253981a-25fe-44bb-bcd0-6827827c99e0.png)
  
o Identity-based policies: Identity-based policies are the permissions stored in the form of JSON format. This policy can be attached to an identity user, group of users or role. It determines the actions that the users can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions.

Identity-based policies are further classified into two categories:

o Managed Policies: Managed Policies are the identity-based policies which can be attached to multiple users, groups or roles. There are two types of managed policies:

o AWS Managed Policies
AWS Managed Policies are the policies created and managed by AWS. If you are using the policies first time, then we recommend you to use AWS Managed Policies.

o Custom Managed Policies
Custom Managed Policies are the identity-based policies created by user. It provides more precise control over the policies than AWS Managed Policies.

o Inline Policies
Inline Policies are the policies created and managed by user. These policies are encapsulated directly into a single user, group or a role.

o Resource-Based Policies
Resource-based policies are the policies which are attached to the resource such as S3 bucket. Resource-based policies define the actions that can be performed on the resource and under what condition, these policies can be applied.

o Permissions boundaries
Permissions boundaries are the maximum permissions that identity-based policy can grant to the entity.

o Service Control Policies (SCPs)
Service Control Policies are the policies defined in a JSON format that specify the maximum permissions for an organization. If you enable all the features in an Organization, then you can apply Service Control Policies to any or all of your AWS accounts. SCP can limit the permission on entities in member accounts as well as AWS root user account.

o Access Control Lists (ACLs)
ACL defines the control that which principals in another AWS account can access the resource. ACLs cannot be used to control the access of a principal in a different AWS account. It is the only policy type which does not have the JSON policy document format.

![Easy](<https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg>)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- Following are the different types of routing policies in route53:

- Simple Routing Policy

  Simple Routing Policy is a simple round-robin policy which is applied to a single resource doing the function for the domain, For example, web server is sending the content to a website where web server is a single resource.
  It responds to DNS queries based on the values present in the resource.

- Weighted Routing Policy

  Weighted Routing Policy allows you to route the traffic to different resources in specified proportions. For example, 75% in one server, and 25% in another server.
  Weights can be assigned in the range from 0 to 255.

  Weight Routing policy is applied when there are multiple resources accessing the same function. For example, web servers accessing the same website. Each web server will be given a unique weight number.

  Weighted Routing Policy associates the multiple resources to a single DNS name.

- Latency-based Routing Policy
  Latent-based Routing Policy allows Route53 to respond to the DNS query at which data center gives the lowest latency.
  Latency-based Routing policy is used when there are multiple resources accessing the same domain. Route53 will identify the resource that provides the fastest response with lowest latency.

- Failover Routing Policy
- Geolocation Routing Policy

![Easy](<https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg>)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- There are two types of access:

  - Console Access
    If the user wants to use the Console Access, a user needs to create a password to login in an AWS account.

  - Programmatic access
    If you use the Programmatic access, an IAM user need to make an API calls. An API call can be made by using the AWS CLI. To use the AWS CLI, you need to create an access key ID and secret access key.

- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network provided to your AWS account. When you create a virtual cloud, you need to specify the IPv4 addresses which is in the form of CIDR block. After creating a VPC, you need to create the subnets in each availability zone. Each subnet has a unique ID. When launching instances in each availability zone, it will protect your applications from the failure of a single location.
