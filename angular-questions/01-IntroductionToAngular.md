2. What is meant by SPA?

<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>

- It is a single web page, website, or web application that works within a web browser and loads just a single document.
- It does not need page reloading during its usage, and most of its content remains the same while only some of it needs updating.
- **Gmail**, **Facebook**, **Trello**, **Google Maps**, etc., all are Single Page Applications that offer an outstanding user experience in the browser with no page reloading.

3. Angular workflow or How does Angular work or bootstrapping your angular app?

<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
  
- Flow: `angular.json`-> `main.ts` -> `AppModule` -> `AppModule` -> `index.html`.
- Every Angular app consists of a file named `angular.json` . This file will contain all the configurations of the app. While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application.

- Inside the build section, the main property of the options object defines the entry point of the application which in this case is `main.ts`.
- `main.ts` is the entry point of the angular application. 
- The `main.ts` file creates a browser environment for the application to run, and, along with this, it also calls a function called bootstrapModule, which bootstraps the application. These two steps are performed in the following order inside the `main.ts` file:
	
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103101208/185569651-35a2ba9f-73fc-43c6-8548-0a24daac640b.png)
- In the above line of code, `AppModule` is getting bootstrapped.
- The `AppModule` is declared in the `app.module.ts` file. This module contains declarations of all the components.
- Below is an example of `app.module.ts` file:
	
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103101208/185569778-9ff0d34a-b0e2-4701-a1db-21919ebd3ad7.png)
	
- As one can see in the above file, `AppComponent` is getting bootstrapped.
- This component is defined in `app.component.ts` file. This file interacts with the webpage and serves data to it.
- Below is an example of `app.component.ts` file:
  
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103101208/185569886-8ca076a7-6633-4d61-beb5-0d673014b347.png)

- After this, Angular calls the `index.html` file. This file consequently calls the root component that is `app-root`. 
- This is how the `index.html` file looks:
	
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103101208/185569990-6c67e5b0-d9a6-4340-b2f0-dcd9a9f738c5.png)
	
- The HTML template of the root component is displayed inside the `<app-root>` tags.
- This is how every angular application works. Or This is how angular application get bootstrapped

4. How SPA is different from tradtional web application?
<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>
  
- In traditional web technology, the client requests for a web page (HTML/JSP) and the server sends the resource (or HTML page), and the client again requests for another page and the server responds with another resource. 
- The problem here is a lot of time is consumed in the requesting/responding or due to a lot of reloading. 
- Whereas, in the SPA technology, we maintain only one page (`index.html`) even though the URL keeps on changing.

9. What are some advantages of Angular?
  
<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
  <blockquote>
    
- Effective cross platform development
- Two-way data binding in Angular will help users to exchange data from the component to view and from view to the component.  It will help users to establish communication bi-directionally. 
- The Angular command-line interface (CLI) makes the developerâ€™s job easier because it offers a set of helpful tools for coding. 
- Angular offers powerful DI (dependency injection) instrument and services to resolve various productivity issues and speed up the development process.
- Modularity of angular application makes our code readable and testable

10. What do you choose between Traditional Web Apps and Single Page Apps
<details>
<summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>
Choose based on the explanation given
</blockquote> 
<details>
<summary><b>Explanation</b></summary>
Use traditional web applications when:
- Your application's client-side requirements are simple or even read-only.
- Your application needs to function in browsers without JavaScript support.

Use a SPA when:

- Your application must expose a rich user interface with many features.
- Your team is familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, or Blazor WebAssembly development.
- Your application must already expose an API for other (internal or public) clients.

Additionally, SPA frameworks require greater architectural and security expertise.
