1. Why we need Node.js for Angular?
<details>
<summary><b>Show Answer</b></summary>
<blockquote>

We use Node.js and npm as tools for building Angular or React apps. Angular is a front-end framework used to create a web application and is written in Typescript. The browser only understands JavaScript code, so we need to compile Typescript (.ts file) to plain JavaScript (.js file). We use Node.js and npm to perform this compilation, then we can deploy them in production.
