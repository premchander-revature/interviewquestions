 Yes, we have learned various Spring modules like, Core Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring AOP, Spring Boot etc. We have implemented the RESTful microservices final capstone project as well using Spring boot.

A framework generally provides some base functionality which can be used and extend to make complex applications easily. E.g., Spring MVC It provides everything you need to get off the ground building website using the MVC pattern, it handles web requests, view, routes etc.<br>
**Explanation** <br>
A software framework, in computer programming, is an abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing specific functionality. Frameworks are a special case of software libraries in that they are reusable abstractions of code wrapped in a well-defined Application programming interface (API), yet they contain some key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries.

Spring is award winning dependency injection framework used to build simple, web & complex enterprise applications more easily with the set of predefined modules.
Explanation:  The Spring framework is one of the most popular application development frameworks of Java. The important feature of the spring framework is dependency injection or the Inversion of Control. With the help of Spring Framework, we are able to develop a loosely coupled application. It's packed with some nice out of the box modules like:
 1.	Spring JDBC
 2.	Spring MVC
 3.	Spring Security
 4.	Spring AOP
 5.	Spring ORM
 6.	Spring Test
    
These modules can drastically reduce the development time of an application. For example, in the early days of Java web development, we needed to write a lot of boilerplate code to insert a record into a data source. By using the **JdbcTemplate** of the Spring JDBC module, we can reduce it to a few lines of code with only a few configurations.

Spring is modular by design. From configuration to security, web apps to big data—whatever the infrastructure needs of your application may be, there is a Spring Project to help you build it. Few commonly used projects listed below-
1.	**Spring Framework** - Provides core support for dependency injection, transaction management, web apps, data access, messaging, and more.
2.	**Spring Boot** - Takes an opinionated view of building Spring applications and gets you up and running as quickly as possible.
3.	**Spring Data** - Provides a consistent approach to data access – relational, non-relational, map-reduce, and beyond.
4.	**Spring Cloud** - Provides a set of tools for common patterns in distributed systems. Useful for building and deploying microservices.
5.	**Spring Security** - Protects your application with comprehensive and extensible authentication and authorization support.
6.	**Spring Batch** - Simplifies and optimizes the work of processing high-volume batch operations.
7.	**Spring HATEOAS** - Simplifies creating REST representations that follow the HATEOAS principle.
8.	**Spring REST Docs** - Lets you document RESTful services by combining hand-written documentation with auto-generated snippets produced with Spring MVC Test or REST Assured.
9.	**Spring For Apache Kafka** - Provides Familiar Spring Abstractions for Apache Kafka.
10.	**Spring Vault** - Provides familiar Spring abstractions for HashiCorp Vault

**Note**: We use first four project as part of our Spring and Microservices curriculum.
