 Yes, we have learned various Spring modules like, Core Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring AOP, Spring Boot etc. We have implemented the RESTful microservices final capstone project as well using Spring boot.

A framework generally provides some base functionality which can be used and extend to make complex applications easily. E.g., Spring MVC It provides everything you need to get off the ground building website using the MVC pattern, it handles web requests, view, routes etc.<br>
**Explanation** <br>
A software framework, in computer programming, is an abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing specific functionality. Frameworks are a special case of software libraries in that they are reusable abstractions of code wrapped in a well-defined Application programming interface (API), yet they contain some key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries.

Spring is award winning dependency injection framework used to build simple, web & complex enterprise applications more easily with the set of predefined modules.
Explanation:  The Spring framework is one of the most popular application development frameworks of Java. The important feature of the spring framework is dependency injection or the Inversion of Control. With the help of Spring Framework, we are able to develop a loosely coupled application. It's packed with some nice out of the box modules like:
 1.	Spring JDBC
 2.	Spring MVC
 3.	Spring Security
 4.	Spring AOP
 5.	Spring ORM
 6.	Spring Test
    
These modules can drastically reduce the development time of an application. For example, in the early days of Java web development, we needed to write a lot of boilerplate code to insert a record into a data source. By using the **JdbcTemplate** of the Spring JDBC module, we can reduce it to a few lines of code with only a few configurations.
