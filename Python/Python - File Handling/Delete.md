 - Many a times you need to delete the file instead of closing it.
 - If you try to delete the file which is not present, it will `throw` an Input Output error.

```python
import os
#delete file
os.remove("File.txt")
```

> The remove objects and path are described in the os module and hence it is to be imported.

    <blockquote>

```python
open("myFile.txt", "r") as fObj
#perform file operations
fObj.close()
```

 - It is always a good practice to close the file after using it.

Or else,
 - We can use "with" statement while opening the file. We donâ€™t have to explicitly close the file object. As soon as the pointer goes out of the 'with' statement block, the file object is closed.
  
```python
with open("myFile.txt", "r") as fObj:
#perform file operations
#file is closed automatically
```
