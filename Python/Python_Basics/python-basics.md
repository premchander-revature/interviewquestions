![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
> Keywords are the reserved words that have a special meaning in python. We cannot use keywords as identifier, function or variable name. All the keywords are in lower case except `True` and `False`. Python 3.7 have 33 keywords in total. 
  
**For Example**: and, or, if, elif,True, etc.

4.What is identifiers? 

![Simple](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
> - Identifier is the name given to variable, function, class, etc in python. It consists of character, digit and underscore("_", [special character]). 
> - Identifier should start with a character or an underscore. 
> - A character can be a lowercase(a-z) or uppercase(A-Z). 
> - A digit(0-9) can be placed at any position except at the starting. 
> - No special characters(@,!,#,$,%,&) are allowed other than underscore. 
  
For Example:  first_name, _rollNo, id_1, etc.

9.How do you differentiate between Interpreter and Compiler?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
 
>- Compiler translates our program in a single run, whereas Interpreter translates our program line by line.
>- In terms of CPU utilization, Compiler utilizes more CPU than Interpreter. 
>- During compilation, all the errors in the program are displayed in the end together, whereas in Interpreter errors of the code are displayed line by line. 
>- As the code size increases, complier takes more time to scan a code compared to Interpreters.
>- Example: C, C++, java, etc are based on Compiler whereas Python, Ruby, MATLAB, etc are interpreted language.

10.Is Python an Interpreted or Compiled language?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
> Python is an Interpreted language because it checks the code line by line and not all together. For example, suppose there are 2 errors in the code, one in line 3 and other in line 4. When you execute the code, it will throw error in line 3 of console( output screen) but not in line 4,because it checks the code one line at a time.

15.Define Namespace and explain the types of namespaces in python. 

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg) 

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
> A namespace is a way to provide unique name for each and every object in python. An object can be a variable or a method. There are three types of namespace present in python:  
> i) **Local Namespace:** the variable names defined in a class, function, loop or in any block of code comes under local namespace. These variables cannot be accessed by outer Namespace in python. Local namespace can access the global namespace objects and built-in namespace.

> ii) **Global Namespace:** the object name that are defined in a main program or in a module comes under global namespace. These are outside any function or block of code. It can access the builtin namespace objects. 

> iii) **Built-in Namespace:** it contains the names of built-in methods and variables. It can be a datatype, exceptions or methods like print() & input(). 

**Example**: 
  
```python
def student(name):
    new_name ="rohit"   #local namespace
    return new_name

name ="rohan"     #global namespace
print(student(name))  #built-in namespace 
```
output: rohit

21.What is the difference between `and` and `or` operators?
  
![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)
  
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
 
> Both `and` and `or` are logical operators which requires two operands and both returns True and False values after evaluation. The "and" operator returns True when both the operands are True, else returns False, whereas "or" operator returns True if either operand is True and returns False when both operands are False.

22.Predict the output for the following code.
  
![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)
  
```python

b) 5  
&emsp;1 
  
c) 9   
&emsp;9
  
d) 9   
&emsp;0    
  
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
> Option b) 5  
 &emsp; &emsp;1 

<details><summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary> 
  
> In the first print statement, logical "and" operator is used, which checks if both operand values are non- zero and it will return the value of operand mentioned in the last i.e 'b=5'. In the second print statement, bitwise operator '&' is used, which converts the operand values to binary[ in terms of 0 and 1] and compares and returns 1 if both the bits are 1 otherwise, it returns 0. So, a=9 in binary is 1001 and b=5 in binary is 0101. Therefore after comparing both operand values bit by bit, we get final result as 0001 in binary which is equal to 1 in decimal format. Hence, the output (b).

```
a) 377 
  
b) 5
  
c) 5.0 
  
d) 2 
  
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
> Option is c) 5.0. 

<details><summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary> 
  
> According to precedence of operators, Exponent(**) has the highest precedence in this expression. After that Multiplication(*), Division(/), Floor division(//) all three have same precedence so, it is evaluated from left to right order in an expression, finally ending with Addition(+). So 2**3 will get evaluated first which gives,'8'. Then 10//8 gives 1 because of floor division, 1*3 gives '3' and 4/2 gives '2.0'. Hence, the final result will come out as 3+2.0 = 5.0

46. What are the Bitwise operators present in python?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
>- Bitwise operators first converts the integer to binary and then performs bit-by-bit operations on it. The final result is returned in decimal format. 
In python, there are 6 Bitwise operators:
>- '&' - Bitwise AND
>- '|' - Bitwise OR 
>- '~' - Bitwise NOT 
>- '^' - Bitwise XOR 
>- '>>' - Bitwise right shift 
>- '<<' - Bitwise left shift

47.What is the use of left shift and right shift operators?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>

> - *Bitwise left shift* operator shifts the bits of the integer number to the left and put 0 on voids right as a result.         
For example:    
x = 4 = 0100 (binary)         
x << 1 = 1000 = 8   # Here it shifts the bit by 1 on the left side.
<br />
 *Bitwise right shift* operator shifts the bits of integer number to the right and put 0 on voids left as a result.    
For example:      
x = 4 = 0100 (binary)       
x >> 1 = 0010 = 2  # Here it shifts the bit by 1 on the right side.

 c) 14                    
&emsp;1 

 d) 14     
&emsp;2 
     
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
option is b) 

<details><summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary> 
  
> In both the print statements Bitwise operators are used. In first print statement, bitwise or operator is used which converts values of a and b in binary and returns 1 if either of the bit is 1 else 0. Binary value of 5 is 0101 and binary value of 10 is 1010 so the resultant will be 1111 in binary which is equivalent to 15 in decimal. Therefore 1st print statement prints 15 as output. In 2nd print statement Bitwise right shift operator is used which shifts the bits of a number to the right and fills 0 on voids left. So 1010 is shifted twice to the right as mentioned in print statement and we got the result as 0010 in binary which is equivalent to 2 in decimal. Hence the output 15 and 2.

 d) -6.67 
 
<details><summary> <b>Show Answer</b> </summary>
  
> Option c) -5.67 

<details><summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary> 
  
> The operations will be performed based on the precedence of operators. Exponent (**) operator has the highest precedence in this expression.It evaluates first resulting in 16. After that Multiplication(*), Division(/), Floor division(//) all three have same precedence. so, it is evaluated from left to right order in an expression. And at last subtraction(-). Therefore, 20//16 gives 1 and 10*2/3 gives 6.67. At last 1 - 6.67 results in -5.67, hence the answer.
