1.Predict the output for the below code.

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num1=11;
		int num2=011;
		System.out.println(num1 == num2);
	}
}

A.0
B.1
C.true
D.false

Answer:D
Explanation: If we add zero before a number, the value will become octal number. The octal number is converted into decimal value and assigned to int variable. The value of num1 is 11 and value of num2 is 9 that are not equal. The output is false.
