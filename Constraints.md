![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- In a table, a constraint is a rule that restricts the values which can be entered into it.
- When you construct it, it can be added to a table or a view. A table can be made without restrictions.
- To improve the quality and integrity of data by utilising limitations. We can make sure the data complies with the standards we have established for it. Eg. Variable pay for an employee is not null.

2.What are the types of constraints in SQL ?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

In SQL five types of constraints are there 
- <b>Primary Key Constraint</b>: It serves as a means of identifying a table's row and ensures that every row has a unique value that cannot be NULL.
- <b>Foreign Key Constraint</b>: It makes sure that the values in one column correspond to those in another table's column.
- <b>Unique Constraint</b>: It makes sure each row in the table contains a different value.
- <b>Not Null Constraint</b>: It guarantees that a value can't be NULL.
- <b>Check Constraint</b>: A certain need is met by the check restriction.

3.How do we create a constraint?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

When introducing a constraint as a component of the CREATE statement, there are two ways to define it:
1.Inline: next to the line of the column 
2.Out of line: at the conclusion of the CREATE statement

4.How should we name a constraints?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- You should be able to determine which table and column a constraint applies to by looking at its name.
- Constraint name having a  combination of :
    - A two letter term indicates the type of constraint.
    - Table name is abbreviated
    - an abbreviated name for the constraint's columns or rule
There would be an underscore between each of these. 
For instance, the primary key "pk employee id" refers to the column with in employee table (emp) and is a primary key (pk) (id)

5.What is mean by primary key constraint?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- The row's identification is referred to as a primary key constraint. It must have a uniques value for the column and it cannot be NULL
- A table can have only one primary key on it. Use of a second primary key results in an error.
- It works in the combination of both Not null constraint and Unique constraint.

- There can only be one primary key for table or view.
- Any of the following types of columnsâ€” LOB, BFILE, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, LONG, LONG RAW, VARRAY, NESTED TABLE, REF, or a user-defined type cannot be used as the primary key columns.
- There can be no more than 32 columns in a composite primary key.
- A primary key and a nique constraint cannot be a part in the same column or the combination of columns.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
<summary> <b>Explanation</b> </summary>

<blockquote>

- To connect a column(s) in one table with a primary key or unique key in another table, a foreign key constraint is used.
- A record in one table is related to a record in another table thanks to the ability to enforce referential integrity.
- Your tables should have foreign key constraints on them if you want to make sure that the quality data in your database.
- By use of foreign keys make sure you relate your data correctly.

-There must already be a primary key or unique key created on the table be referenced by the foreign key.
- It cannot have more than 32 columns.
- The table contains both the primary key and unique key constraint must be on the same database.
- When using CREATE TABLE AS to create a table and using a subquery in the AS clause, a foreign key cannot be defined. To accomplish this, you should first create the table before using the ALTER TABLE statement to add one.

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

ON DELETE clause is the clause of a foreign key.
There are two options:
- ON DELETE SET NULL: When the parent record is deleted, all of the child records' referenced columns will be set to NULL.
- ON DELETE SET CASCADE: All of the child records will also be deleted when the parent record is also deleted.
