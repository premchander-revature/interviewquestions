It Gets all the props of List Interface.
It isnt thread safe.
by defualt 10 memory locations once filled, it will regrow
by doing this -> previous_memory_size+ 50% of previous_memory_size.
it is Contiguous
Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.
It is like an array, but there is no size limit. We can add or remove elements anytime. 
So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array. It is found in the java.util package.

Hashmap Gets all the props of Map.
In HashMap, one key can be null and any number of values can be null.
it doesnt maintain the order of insertion.

3. Brief us on Map

<details>

<blockquote>
Map is a part of Collections f/w but not under Collection interface.
Map comes with Key and Value pair where every Value is dependent on the Key.
Key is unique and value can be duplicated.
it is unindexed an unordered.
Map is implemented in HashMap,LinkeHashMap,TreeMap and Hashtable classes.

4. Explain about Collections such as List, Set, deque, stack, queue and arrays and when to use each. 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
 list
It contains the index-based methods to insert, update, delete and search the elements. It can have the duplicate elements also. We can also store the null elements in the list.
 set
  The set is an interface available in the java.util package. The set interface extends the Collection interface. An unordered collection or list in which       duplicates are not allowed is referred to as a collection interface.
 stack
 The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the collection of objects. It is based on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).
 queue
 Java Queue represents an ordered list of elements. Java Queue follows FIFO order to insert and remove it's elements. 
 Arrays
 Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location.

5. How to remove duplicate values from a List?

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
To remove duplicate elements from the arraylist, we have Add all elements from arraylist to set
Empty the arraylist using clear() method
Add all elements from set to arraylist
Here, we have used the LinkedHashSet to create a set. It is because it removes the duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
Deque in Java is a subtype of the queue interface in java.util package. It supports a linear data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements at both ends. It can be used both as a queue (FIFO policy) and as a stack (LIFO policy). Deque is an acronym for double-ended queue.

7. What is the difference between Arrays and ArrayLists?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
Major difference between Array and ArrayList in Java is that Array is a fixed-length data structure while ArrayList is a variable-length Collection class. You  can not change the length of Array once created in Java but ArrayList re-size itself when gets full depending upon the capacity and load factor.
Another difference between Array and ArrayList in Java is that you can not use Generics along with Array, as Array instance knows about what kind of type it can hold and throws ArrayStoreException if you try to store type which is not convertible into the type of Array. ArrayList allows you to use Generics to ensure type safety.

Hashmap
Hashmap Gets all the props of Map.
Hashmap contains one key can be null and any number of values can be null.
It doesnt maintain the order of insertion.
It is not thread safe.
  
 Hash table
It implements Map.
It is generally known as no null Map or no null table i.e neither a key nor a value can be null over here.
It is thread safe.
It wont maintain the order of insertion.

9. What are some differences between collections, collection interface, and the collections framework?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
collections
A Java Collection is a predefined architecture capable of storing a group of elements and behaving like a single unit such as an object or a group. 
collections framework
A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.
 
collection interface
The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the collection framework. It declares the methods that every collection will have. In other words, we can say that the Collection interface builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends.

<blockquote>
Lists:: A list is an ordered collection of elements that are distinguished by their indices. List elements can be of any data type—primitive types, collections, sObjects, user-defined types, and built-in Apex types.

Maps:: A map is a collection of key-value pairs where each unique key maps to a single value. Keys and values can be any data type—primitive types, collections, sObjects, user-defined types, and built-in Apex types.

11. What is the difference between list and set?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
List looks exactly like an Array but it is dynamic.
It maintains order of insertion.
It allows duplications.
It allows any number of null values.
List is implemented in ArrayList,Vector and LinkedList classes.
List is indexed i.e it has positions for all the values.
  set
set is a collection which is unindexed(no positions for elements) and it wont allow dups.
Set internally uses hashing algorithm which generates the memory 
based on the input data, hence it wont allow dups.
internally it checks for duplications using equals & hashCode method.

<blockquote>
A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object. The class itself must implements the java.lang.Comparable interface to compare its instances.
Unlike Comparable, Comparator is external to the element type we are comparing. It’s a separate class. We create multiple separate classes (that implement Comparator) to compare by different members.

LinkedList implements List,Queue and Dequeue.
It isnt thread safe class.
It allocates only one memory at a time when new element is coming in
It will create one more.
Memory is not contiguous.
Insertion and Deletion is much faster here then other classes.
LinkedList maintains a node like a struc
