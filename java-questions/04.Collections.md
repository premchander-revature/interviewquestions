It Gets all the props of List Interface.
It isnt thread safe.
by defualt 10 memory locations once filled, it will regrow
by doing this -> previous_memory_size+ 50% of previous_memory_size.
it is Contiguous

Hashmap Gets all the props of Map.
In HashMap, one key can be null and any number of values can be null.
it doesnt maintain the order of insertion.
it is not thread safe.

3. Brief us on Map

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
Map is a part of Collections f/w but not under Collection interface.
Map comes with Key and Value pair where every Value is dependent on the Key.
Key is unique and value can be duplicated.
it is unindexed an unordered.
Map is implemented in HashMap,LinkeHashMap,TreeMap and Hashtable classes.

5. How to remove duplicate values from a List?

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
To remove duplicate elements from the arraylist, we have 
Add all elements from arraylist to set
Empty the arraylist using clear() method
Add all elements from set to arraylist
Here, we have used the LinkedHashSet to create a set. It is because it removes the duplicate elements and maintains insertion order.

<blockquote>
 Deque in Java is a subtype of the queue interface in java.util package. It supports a linear data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements at both ends. It can be used both as a queue (FIFO policy) and as a stack (LIFO policy). Deque is an acronym for double-ended queue.

7. What is the difference between Arrays and ArrayLists?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
Major difference between Array and ArrayList in Java is that Array is a fixed-length data structure while ArrayList is a variable-length Collection class. You  can not change the length of Array once created in Java but ArrayList re-size itself when gets full depending upon the capacity and load factor.
Another difference between Array and ArrayList in Java is that you can not use Generics along with Array, as Array instance knows about what kind of type it can hold and throws ArrayStoreException if you try to store type which is not convertible into the type of Array. ArrayList allows you to use Generics to ensure type safety.

 Hash table
  It implements Map.
It is generally known as no null Map or no null table i.e neither a key nor a value can be null over here.
It is thread safe.
It wont maintain the order of insertion.
