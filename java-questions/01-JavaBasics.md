There are two kinds of memory used in Java. 
stack memory 
heap memory.

 Scope of a variable denotes span of a variable.

The scope of a local variable is within that method i.e. when we create a variable with in a method, it cannot be accessed outside that method.

<blockquote>
When we use static before variable or method that will not belong to any object,it belongs to the class.
There is no need to create an object for the class to access the static variable or static method. We can use the class name to call them with respect to the access modifier.
If we use the object name to call the static method or variable, the compiler will replace the name of the object with class.

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
 Public- it is access specifier from anywhere we can access it.
 Static- it is access modifier we can call the methods directly by class name without creating its objects
 Void- it is the return type  
 Main- it is a method name  
 String[]args- in java we accept only the string type of argument and store it.

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
Stack memory is the space allocated for a process where all the function calls, primitive data types like int, double, etc., and local and reference variables of the functions are stored. Stack memory is always accessed in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.
Heap memory is used to store the objects that are created during the execution of a Java program. Heap follows dynamic memory allocation (memory is allocated during execution or runtime) and provides random access, unlike stack, which follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.
