<blockquote>
Lambda expression provides a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. It is very useful in collection library. It helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection.

The Lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has functional interface. It saves a lot of code. In case of lambda expression, we don't need to define the method again for providing the implementation. Here, we just write the implementation code.

Java lambda expression is treated as a function, so compiler does not create .class file.

<blockquote>
 Aggregation is actually a special form of association. This means that it is referred as the relationship between two classes like Association. However, it’s a directional association, which means it strictly follows a one-way association. This represents a HAS-A relationship.

<blockquote>
 Stream API is a collection of objects which can be processed to get the desired result.
A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result. The features of Java stream are –
A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined.
Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
Example: If we want to filter the movies released in 2022 from the movie database.

Method reference
It is to refer the method of functional interface. While using a lambda expression to refer to a method, we can use a method reference instead of a lambda expressison.

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
static interface
It is a static method which belongs to the interface only. We can write implementation of this method in interface itself
default method
It is a method with default keyword and class can override this method

9. Tell me about functional interface

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
 A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit. From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface. A functional interface can have any number of default methods.

10. Do you know Method References? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details>
  <summary> <b>Show Answer</b></summary>
  
<blockquote>
Java provides a new feature called method reference in Java 8. Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface. It is compact and easy form of lambda expression. Each time when you are using lambda expression to just referring a method, you can replace your lambda expression with method reference.
